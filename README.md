# Notes about python 
I am supposed to write something

### Now the text is smaller. Theoretically. Oh i just saw it it's legit

* this doesn't seem to do much
* Oh nevermind it's a bullet thing
* I need to bold a singular word. **Like this**
* Also python keywords can be fancy colors, like `if` nvm it's just grey rip

```python
weather = 78
if weather < 40:
  print("Bring a winter jacket dumba..person")
elif weather < 60:
  print("a light jacket would e good")
else:
  print("If u wear a jacket in this weather I'd go to the doctor")
```
